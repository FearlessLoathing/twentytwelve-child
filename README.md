New Fearless and Loathing theme based off of Wordpress's Twenty Twelve theme.

Major focus:
Make the page more accessible by removing the dropdowns and adding a second 
level navigation system.

Other areas of improvement:
-figure out a more direct way of handling bylines
-customize metadata at the end of posts (it's a bit wordy at the moment)

Navigation ideas:
This is just how I picture it working. When you go to the second level navigation the unselected ones should go gray and the selected on should remain the inverse. Hovering over one of the second level options should make it invert (if the selected main section went un-inverted at the same time that'd be cool.) When a second level is selected and it has no children its siblings should remain visible but grey, and the selected item should be inverted. 

I think it'd make for a cool kinda waterfall of color effect.
